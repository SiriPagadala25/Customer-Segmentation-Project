# Customer-Segmentation-Project

# Description
Customer segmentation is a crucial process in marketing and business strategy, allowing companies to group customers based on their behavior, preferences, and demographics. This project develops an automated system that segments customers using data science techniques, focusing on Machine Learning (ML) and clustering algorithms.

#Abstract
Customer segmentation helps businesses understand their target audience and tailor marketing strategies accordingly. This project employs data science techniques, including ML and clustering algorithms, to segment customers based on attributes such as:

#Existing System
  -Manual segmentation based on intuition and historical data
  -Rule-based filtering methods
  -Generic marketing campaigns not tailored to individual needs 
  -Limited real-time analysis

# Limitations
  -Inefficient and time-consuming
  -Prone to inaccurate groupings
  -Inability to handle large-scale data dynamically

# Proposed System
  -Automated segmentation using Machine Learning
  -Clustering algorithms: K-Means, Hierarchical Clustering, DBSCAN
  -Real-time classification into segments
  -Adaptable across industries and business models
  -Integration with CRM/marketing platforms for targeted campaigns
